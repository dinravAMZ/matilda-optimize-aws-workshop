Matilda Optimize provides the details you need to identify orphan resources so that you can address them quickly and easily.

## Orphan and Unused Resource Significance

Orphan resources often consume valuable financial and operational resources without providing any tangible business value. They can add unnecessary complexity, lead to security vulnerabilities, and make resource management cumbersome. Importantly, they also contribute to inflated cloud costs that can eat into your organization's budget.

By identifying these orphan resources, Matilda Optimize allows you to streamline operations, improve security, and realize immediate cost savings with precision and efficiency.
