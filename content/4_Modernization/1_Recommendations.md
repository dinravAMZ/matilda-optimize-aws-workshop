## Modernization Recommendations

Just as we did with right sizing, you can find modernization recommendations by searching for the keyword **“modernize”** in the search bar above the recommendation list. In the example below, we will dive into a recommendation called **Modernize the EC2 Instance** with a Resource ID of matildaclient.

By left-clicking the recommendation, you can again view important details for this instance. By clicking the item under **On Demand**, in this case “matildaclient,” you will see the recommended configuration, which is estimated to save the user over $38 per month. Note the recommended instance type and the on-demand cost per hour at the bottom. Scroll down to examine the current and projected CPU utilization and network throughput utilization.

Each organization has unique priorities in terms of cost and scalability. Since modernization is about more than just cost, some organizations will see recommendations that reflect a move towards more scalability at a similar cost point. You might find recommendations that increase the on-demand cost, but enable superior performance. Matilda Optimize is customized to your organization, not a one-size-fits-all set of policies.

In this workshop, we won’t cover all types of right sizing that are provided in Matilda Optimize. Feel free to explore the other recommendations around shutting down instances, which provide immense cost-cutting opportunities for AWS customers without impacting performance.
