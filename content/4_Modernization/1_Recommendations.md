## Modernization Recommendations

Just as we did with right sizing, you can find modernization recommendations by selecting the **Right Sizing** button at the top of the **Recommendations** page. In the example below, we will dive into a recommendation called **Modernize the EC2 Instance** with a Resource ID of matildaclient.

By clicking the recommendation, you can again view important details for this instance. By clicking the item under **On Demand**, in this case “matildaclient,” you will see the recommended configuration, which is estimated to save the user over $38 per month. Note the recommended instance type and the on-demand cost per hour at the bottom. Scroll down to examine the current and projected CPU utilization and network throughput utilization.

In this workshop, we won’t cover all types of right sizing that are provided in Matilda Optimize. Feel free to explore the other recommendations around shutting down instances, which provide immense cost-cutting opportunities for AWS customers without impacting performance.
