## Finding the Recommendation

**There are many ways to locate types of recommendations in Matilda Optimize.** The top of the recommendations page provides a few different ways to locate the recommendation you are looking for.

For now, we will look for right sizing recommendations focused on resizing instances while staying within the instance family. More generally, all right sizing recommendations can be filtered by selecting the **Right Sizing** button at the top of the recommendations page.

The fastest way to locate specific recommendations is to use the search bar by clicking the magnifying glass at the top right corner of the list. Here are a few of the keywords you can search for to help you locate a right sizing recommendation…

* “Increase” or “Decrease” will locate recommendations to resize within instance family
* “Request” and “Resize” will also find similar types of recommendations
* “Modernize” will provide right sizing recommendations between instance families

In addition to searching for recommendations, you can browse through the list of recommendations with filters at the top of the page or on the top right-hand corner of the recommendations page.

For now, search for one of the above keywords and select a right sizing recommendation. In the example below, we examine a recommendation to **Resize an EC2 Instance.**

By clicking the row of that recommendation, a window will open on the right of the screen with all the information collected about this recommendation. Under the On Demand section of the recommendation pane, expand the line item as shown below to view the current and recommended configurations.

In this example, you can see that by resizing this instance, you would save over $17 per month in cloud costs.
