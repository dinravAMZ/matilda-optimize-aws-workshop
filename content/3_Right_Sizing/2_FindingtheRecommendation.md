By clicking the row of that recommendation, a window will open on the right of the screen with all the information collected about this recommendation. Under the On Demand section of the recommendation pane, expand the line item as shown below to view the current and recommended configurations.

By scrolling lower, you can see graphs of the vCPU utilization, network throughput utilization, and disk throughput utilization. By clicking the switch at the top right of these graphs, you can view the projected utilization, which is calculated using an intelligent AI/ML approach.
