# Right Sizing

Our first step towards Intelligent Cloud Optimization is right-sizing. Leveraging the AWS Well-Architected Framework and advanced AI/ML algorithms, Matilda Optimize meticulously assesses AWS workloads, identifying instances that are either overprovisioned or underutilized. 

By optimizing resource allocation and adopting a data-driven approach, we achieve improved performance and significant cost savings.
