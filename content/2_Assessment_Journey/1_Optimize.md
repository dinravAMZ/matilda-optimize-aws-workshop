## Getting to Know Matilda Optimize

![MPW.02.02](/images/MPW.02.02.png)
 
For this workshop, a few onboarding steps are already completed with a hypothetical AWS account. Ordinarily, the first step when using Matilda Optimize is to onboard your company, departments, and provide cloud account information. We have already taken care of that for this exercise.

When opening the tool, you'll notice a blue bar on the left side of the screen. **We call this the left-hand menu.** This menu allows you to navigate through different sections within the tool.

Let's first focus on the dashboard view, which provides high-level cloud cost information, optimization percentage, a breakdown of your top 5 services costs, cost trends, and potential savings breakdowns.

Scroll down and you will see boxes indicating **"Savings By Effort"**. For instance, in this example, we can see that right-sizing VMs could lead to significant savings of over $3,000 in monthly cloud costs.
