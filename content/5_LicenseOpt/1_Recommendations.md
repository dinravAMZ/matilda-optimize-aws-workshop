## License Optimization Recommendations

License optimization recommendations are found under **Savings**. Click the **Savings** button at the top of the page and sort the recommendations to find a BYOL recommendation at the top of the page (alphabetical). 

In this example we will look at the recommendation, **BYOL to License Included recommendations (Windows / SQL Server)**, with a resource name of **mcmawsdev02**.

Again, click on the recommendation to open the **Recommendations** pane providing its details. Under the On Demand section of this recommendation, you will notice the extraordinary savings identified in cost reduction - over $10,500! You can see that this cost savings is based on the total yearly compute cost savings as well as the difference in license costs ($9,500 per year).
